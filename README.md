### A one sentence overview of your repository, meant for someone who is not familiar with the project<br/>
	- Our project rated neighborhoods based upon how easy they were to get around. Our metrics were the number of parking meters (availability of street parking), number of bus stops (availability of public transportation), and walkability ratio (safety for pedestrian traffic).
