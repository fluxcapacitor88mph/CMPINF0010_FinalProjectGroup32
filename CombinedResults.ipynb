Coming in *second* in walkability ‚õÖüö∂‚Äç and *first* in number of parking meters üÖøüöó, Oakland also has a very high density of bus stops üöå. It's clear that the neighborhood sees the importance in effective transportation infrastructure. I don't think the data is deceptive; I find Oakland extremely easy-to-navigate, something of critical importance for the location of a University campus."
